# Dumpcar

[![Ruby Gem version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/dumpcar.svg)](https://rubygems.org/gems/dumpcar) [![Ruby build](https://github.com/wwahammy/dumpcar/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/wwahammy/dumpcar/actions/workflows/main.yml)

Rails commands for dumping and restoring the contents of the PostgreSQL database for your Rails application.

- Dump (`rails dumpcar:dump`) and restore your last dump (`rails dumpcar:restore`) with a single command
- Uses your Rails database credentials for your environment OR any Rails supported Postgres connection string (via `DATABASE_URL`)

## Installation

Install the gem by executing:

```bash
bundle add dumpcar
rails g dumpcar # creates db/dumps folder, adds it to .gitignore and commits
```

## Usage

```bash
rails dumpcar:dump # creates a postgresql dump based on current time like db/dumps/20250601022124.dump
rails dumpcar:restore # restores the last dump made chronologically from the db/dumps directory

# You can use any Postgres connection string that Rails supports
DATABASE_URL=postgres://myuser:mypassword@domain.hosting.pg.db:5432/mydatabase rails dumpcar:dump # creates a postgresql dump of the database at DATABASE_URL
```

## Compatibility

Outside of the `rails dumpcar:dump` and `rails dumpcar:restore` commands, don't expect any compatibility guarantees for now.

## Longer term feature goals

- Support other Rails databases (MySQL and SQLite)
- Support other Rails environments than the current one
- Ability to clean your db/dumps directory of all dumps before a given time
- Add support for naming a dump (you can manually do this now but not via the rake task)
- Restoring a specific dump via filepath
- Restoring a specific dump by timestamp
- Restoring a specific dump by name
- Restoring a specific dump made before or after a given time
- Extension points for other ways to get a database (Easily get a dump from Heroku's Postgres backups, for example)

## Development

NOTE: Using the Devcontainer is one of the easiest ways to get setup. Unfortunately, it also requires a no-charge but proprietary
extension to VSCode to use.

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You should run `bin/appraisal rspec` to run all of the tests on all of the supported Rails versions. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.
